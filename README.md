* BlockMaker

A GUI for making block-type json files for [Boskeopolis Land](http://github.com/jjwmezun/boskeopolis-land). Currently, there is some minimal visual changes to what the user does, but it doesn't save any files. Also, its addresses are hardcoded, so it almost certainly won't work for anyone else. Not truly meant for public use.
